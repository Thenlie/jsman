    "description": "The `splice()` method is a [mutating method](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#copying_methods_and_mutating_methods). It may change the content of `this`. If the specified number of elements to insert differs from the number of elements being removed, the array's `length` will be changed as well. At the same time, it uses [`[Symbol.species]`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Symbol.species) to create a new array instance to be returned. If the deleted portion is [sparse](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Indexed_collections#sparse_arrays), the array returned by `splice()` is sparse as well, with those corresponding indices being empty slots. The `splice()` method is [generic](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#generic_array_methods). It only expects the `this` value to have a `length` property and integer-keyed properties. Although strings are also array-like, this method is not suitable to be applied on them, as strings are immutable."
